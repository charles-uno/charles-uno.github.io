Democrats are running Vice President Harris for president in 2024.
She's been by President Biden's side for the last four years and is his [hand-picked][biden_endorses_harris] successor.
Republicans are running former President Trump, who held the office from 2017 to 2021.
It's unusual to have a presidential election where both[^third_parties] candidates already know their way around the White House. 
This means we have the rare opportunity to make an apples-to-apples[^apples_to_apples_comparison] comparison between them. 
Skip the pearl-clutching about gaffes, tweets, and crimes[^crimes]. 
Between the current administration and the former, who did the job better?

[^apples_to_apples_comparison]: Presidential candidates are typically senators or governors. Senators know about federal lawmaking, but lack executive experience. Governors have executive experience, but it's at the state level rather than federal. 

[biden_endorses_harris]: https://apnews.com/article/biden-drops-out-2024-election-ddffde72838370032bdcff946cfc2ce6

[^third_parties]: Under a parliamentary system, like in the UK, there can be three or more viable political parties. They form coalitions to create a majority government. The Electoral College makes that nearly impossible in the USA. Credible politicians here stick to the two major parties; third parties are full of grifters and clowns. For example, despite 30+ years of attempts, the Green Party has [never won any election][green_officeholders] for state or federal office. Jill Stein, the Green candidate for president, has a laughably weak résumé: she served one-and-a-half terms on city council. 

[^crimes]: [Trump was convicted][trump_conviction] of business fraud after leaving office. Not ideal, obviously, but history shows that sometimes a slimeball can be an effective president. Just look at [LBJ][lbj_slimeball] or [Bill Clinton][clinton_slimeball]. Better to judge Trump by the performance of his administration.

[green_officeholders]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_the_United_States#Officeholders

To be clear: this is a big question. 
The president runs a million-person bureaucracy, commands the most powerful military in history, sets the legislative agenda, and more. 
Each dimension of the job is important in its own way.
Cherry-picking wins and losses doesn't do it justice. 

So let's be systematic. 
Below, we've broken down presidential responsibilities into a handful of categories. 
For each category, we can lay out a few of the most notable policies of each administration. 
Then we can judge not only the priorities of each administration, but also its ability to get things done.

## COVID Response

**Context:** Past presidents have been defined by their response of war, depression, and terrorism. The Trump and Biden/Harris administrations were faced with the worst pandemic in a century plus a global economic crisis.

The federal government under **Trump** took COVID seriously. 
Trump personally did not. 
His mismanagement of the crisis led to tens of thousands of preventable American deaths. 

- Trump signed $3,200 billion in spending for [vaccine development][trump_covid_vaccine_development], [paid leave][trump_covid_paid_leave], and [direct][trump_stimulus] [support][trump_additional_stimulus] for Americans and businesses. The vaccine development program in particular was an incredible success, saving an estimated [140,000 American lives][warp_speed_impact]. 
- Trump also undermined the credibility of the US pandemic response. He [downplayed][trump_downplayed_covid] the severity of the virus, [contradicted][trump_contradicts_officials] public health officials, and elevated [anti-vaccine conspiracy theories][trump_antivax_tweets]. The COVID death rate in the US was very high compared to other wealthy nations, especially in [pro-Trump areas][covid_death_partisan_gap]. The estimated impact is between [70,000][covid_death_partisan_gap] and [150,000][trump_covid_mismanagement_impact] preventable American deaths. 

<!--
- Trump also impeded COVID response globally. He withdrew US membership from the [World Health Organization][trump_who] during the pandemic, along with billions in funding. He also ran a propaganda campaign to [discourage vaccination][trump_covid_propaganda_china] in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
- Trump's OSHA [declined][trump_covid_osha] to set any workplace safety rules related to COVID. 
- Trump was seemingly not involved in the negotiations, and even [threatened][trump_covid_relief_veto_threat] not to sign the bills.
- Trump declined to coordinate pandemic response between states, leaving them to bid against one another for masks, etc. 
- He repeatedly used [racist nicknames][trump_covid_racism] for COVID at a time of record-high [hate crimes][covid_hate_crimes] against Asian Americans.

The **Biden/Harris** administration made federal COVID response an immediate priority upon taking office. Their policies were competent and effective.

- Democrats [passed][bh_stimulus_bill] an additional round of direct payments to Americans on top of the [bipartisan bill][trump_additional_stimulus] Trump had signed a few months earlier. This made pandemic support in the US [more generous][g20_stimulus_comparison] that in most of Europe. Critics [worried][bh_stimulus_concerns] that so much spending would cause the economy to overheat. In fact the US saw a [smoother recovery][post_covid_gdp] than any other wealthy nation: lower unemployment, lower inflation, faster GDP growth, and faster [wage growth][wage_growth] (especially for [low-income workers][low_income_wages]).
- They also invested billions more dollars in testing and vaccination. They campaigned on a promise to distribute 100 million vaccine doses in their first 100 days in office, then did so in [half that time][bh_100m_shots_100_days]. They also [donated][global_vaccines] 700 million vaccine doses globally.

## Working with Congress

**Context:** As the head of government, it's the president's job to set the agenda and work with Congress to get it done. Laws signed by a president can impact Americans for decades after the president leaves office, as can the federal judges they nominate.

**Trump** nominated anti-abortion judges and signed a big tax cut, in line with past Republicans. 
But he struggled to get his own priorities through Congress, such as [infrastructure][trump_infrastructure_week] or the border wall.

- [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act][trump_tax_cuts] --- $1,500 billion tax cut which [mostly benefited the rich][trump_tax_cuts_analysis]. The onset of the pandemic makes it hard to judge the long-term effects, but [similar tax cuts][bush_tax_cut_analysis] in the past have not delivered economic growth. 
- Trump nominated [200+ federal judges][trump_judges_white_male], who will have the power to interpret and strike down laws for decades. His nominations created a conservative supermajority[^rbg] on the Supreme Court, allowing them to [overturn Roe v Wade][dobbs]; this had been a long-term goal of social conservatives. Abortions are now banned in many states, [even in the case of emergencies][emergency_abortion_post_dobbs]. 
- [First Step Act][trump_criminal_justice_reform] (bipartisan) --- Criminal justice reform which reduced mandatory minimum sentencing, ended solitary confinement for minors, mandated de-escalation training for correctional officers, and more. This bill also included $0.4 billion for rehabilitation programs to reduce recidivism. Over 3,000 prisoners were released early in the first year. 
- Trump faced off with Congress over funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border, resulting in the longest federal [government shutdown][trump_wall_shutdown] in US history. About 400,000 federal employees were [furloughed][shutdown_cost] for over a month. Trump ultimately went around Congress by redirecting funds from elsewhere, sparking [numerous lawsuits][trump_wall_emergengy_lawsuits]. By the end of his term, he had built [50 miles][trump_wall_outcome] of the proposed 1,300 mile wall.
- Trump signed $20 billion in federal aid to Puerto Rico after [Hurricane Maria][hurricane_maria] in 2017. But his administration [delayed][trump_hurricane_maria_delay] distribution of that aid, and also blocked an investigation into the causes of the delay. Maria was among the most extreme hurricanes on record, killing 3,000 Americans and causing $100 billion in damage. 

[^rbg]: Conservative justices usually time their retirements so that a conservative president can nominate their replacement, and vice versa. For better or worse, this preserves the ideological makeup of the Supreme Court. The court moved right under Trump because liberal justice [RBG][rbg] died and was replaced with a conservative.

**Biden and Harris** have a strong legislative record. 
They passed several large bills with bipartisan support, as well as a party-line bill to advance Democratic priorities. 

- [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law][bh_infrastructure_bill] (bipartisan) --- $1,200 billion to modernize roads, bridges, public transit, broadband, and so on. Infrastructure spending has been an [elusive long-term goal][obama_and_trump_infrastructure] of both parties. 
- [Inflation Reduction Act][ira] --- $500 billion for clean energy, the largest such investment in history. Spending was offset by an [estimated $700 billion][ira_cbo] from closing corporate tax loopholes and cracking down on wealthy tax cheats. The bill also capped the cost of insulin for seniors.
- [CHIPs and Science Act][bh_chips] (bipartisan) --- $300 billion to strengthen domestic high-tech manufacturing and supply chains. This was, in part, a response to the worldwide chip shortage during COVID. Chip manufacturing in the US has [nearly doubled][chips_impact] since.
- [Safer Communities Act][bh_gun_control] (bipartisan) --- $10 billion for school safety, first responders, and crisis intervention programs. This bill also strengthened background checks and red flag rules. This was the first federal gun law in [30 years][gun_control_history]. 
- [Respect for Marriage Act][bh_marriage_bill] (bipartisan) --- Established protections for same-sex and interracial marriages in case the conservative Supreme Court majority overturns the 2015 marriage equality ruling (as they have [threatened][thomas_overturn_marriage] to do).
- They nominated 200+ federal judges, including [one][bh_scotus] to the Supreme Court. These judges will have the power to interpret and strike down laws for decades. The judges are [mostly women][bh_lots_of_judges]. About half of them have previously worked as civil rights lawyers and public defenders. 

<!--
This bill includes funding for hundreds of thousands of jobs related to electric vehicles, batteries, solar power, modernizing agricultural infrastructure, etc.

## Immigration and the Border

**Context:** the president is in charge of immigration, refugee resettlement, and asylum[^border_asylum]. They are responsible for securing the border against drug trafficking and unauthorized crossings. And they have the power to deport undocumented immigrants from within the US, though the situation is complicated[^undocumented_immigrants].

[^border_asylum]: A migrant fleeing violence or persecution can present themselves at the US border and request asylum. A judge will hear their case and, if legitimate, grant them legal entry to the US. In the past decade, the number of asylum requests has [skyrocketed][recent_asylum_increase]. The system is overloaded. Significant resources are needed to address the backlog at the border, not to mention the [root causes][bh_border_root_cause] in Central America.

[recent_asylum_increase]: https://www.vox.com/politics/24153132/us-border-crisis-mexico-migrant-immigration-asylum

<!--
[bh_border_bill_estimates]: https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/news/majority/murray-releases-text-of-bipartisan-national-security-supplemental
-->

[^undocumented_immigrants]: There are about 10 million undocumented immigrants living in the US. They mostly arrived [between 1990 and 2007][border_historical_trends] due to economic conditions in Mexico. At this point they have [families][mixed_status_families] here. They pay their [taxes][immigrants_good_for_economy] and [don't cause trouble][illegal_immigrant_low_crime]. Not to mention, they make up a sizable portion of the American workforce, particularly in the [agriculture and construction][undocumented_worker_industries] industries. Mass deportation would be a humanitarian and economic nightmare.

[undocumented_worker_industries]: https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2016/11/03/industries-of-unauthorized-immigrant-workers/
[mixed_status_families]: https://www.fwd.us/news/mixed-status-families-1/

**Trump** reduced immigration and refugee resettlement across the board.
He also attempted, unsuccessfully, to increase deportations.

- Trump [separated children from their families][family_separation] in an attempt to deter illegal immigration. Thousands of children (including infants) were held in federal custody. A judge later ordered Trump to reunite the families, but doing so took years due to poor recordkeeping. Family separation was [not effective][family_separation_ineffective] as a deterrent.
- Trump made minimal use of parole, which allows asylum seekers to stay (and [seek work][asylum_work_permit]) in the US while waiting for their case to be heard. Instead, applicants [waited in encampments][remain_in_mexico] in Mexico. Trump also narrowed the definition of asylum. Less than 1% of claims were approved under Trump, compared to 20% before. 
- The Trump administration reduced legal immigration by about 10% compared to Obama's second term. Between [green cards][trump_reduced_legal_immigration], [immigration visas][immigrant_visas_by_year], [relative visas][relative_visas_by_year], and [refugee resettlement][usa_refugees_by_year], that's about 300,000 fewer people from 2017-2019 (excluding 2020-2021 due to COVID). 
- Trump attempted to rescind [DACA][daca], an Obama-era policy that granted provisional legal status to undocumented immigrants who arrived as children before 2007. The Supreme Court blocked Trump's order on [procedural grounds][arbitrary_and_capricious] without ruling on the legality of DACA or its recission. 
- Trump [expanded the authority][trump_increase_ice_power] of ICE to perform arrests and deportations. However, Trump [deported fewer people][deportations_by_year] overall than Obama or Biden. This is mostly a reflection of [conditions at the border][trump_border_analysis]; when CBP is overloaded, they borrow additional agents from ICE.

**Biden/Harris** rolled back Trump's most extreme border policies, but didn't do much to move the ball forward. 
They tried, but failed, to pass comprehensive immigration reform. 

- The Biden/Harris administration rolled back the most aggressive of Trump's border policies. They ended family separation, ended the Muslim ban, stopped construction of the border wall, reaffirmed DACA, and resumed the use of parole for asylum seekers. 
- They also maintained several Trump-era policies such as [deploying troops][bh_troops_to_border] to the border and [closing the border][title_42] during COVID. 
- Biden/Harris attempted to implement a 100-day [deportation moratorium][bh_deportation_moratorium], but were blocked by the courts. They later [issued new guidelines for ICE][bh_restrains_deportations] to halt arrests and deportations from within the US, with the exception of violent criminals.
- They made it possible for people to [apply for asylum remotely][bh_online_asylum_applications] to mitigate the logjam at the border. Nearly a million people have done so. 
- Biden/Harris negotiated a bipartisan [immigration reform bill][immigration_bill_2023] to combat drug smuggling and speed up the years-long asylum process. Republicans withdrew support for the bill at [Trump's request][trump_immigration_bill_campaign].

<!--
They also put [new restrictions][bh_easier_immigration_tougher_asylum] in place on in-person asylum claims. 
- Made an app and opened regional processing centers in Central America to help asylum seekers apply. They also developed an app to allow asylum applications without being physically present at the border. 
- parole
- apprehension and removal at the border
- executive order to shut down the border in the event of too many illegal crossings. crossing dropped after. weather probably helped
Trump torpedoed the immigration bill seemingly because [he thought][trump_immigration_bill_campaign] chaos at the border would help him electorally. 
- Biden/Harris created a new program allowing people to [apply for asylum online][bh_online_asylum_applications], rather than present themselves at the border. 
- No pursuit of new trade deals. No attempt to rejoin TPP. Possibly because Biden/Harris is a loudly pro-union administration, and unions don't like trade deals.

## Foreign Policy

**Context:** The president is in charge of the Department of State, which conducts diplomacy on behalf of the world's largest economy. 
They also command the most powerful military in human history. 
Much of the current world order is built on this strength.
The US deters Russian expansion in Europe as well as Chinese aggression against Taiwan. 
We also have a complicated relationship in the Middle East, where we have a history of both fighting[^middle_east_wars] and mediating[^middle_east_mediation].

[^middle_east_wars]: The US was [sporadically][operation_praying_mantis] [engaged][gulf_war] in the Middle East in the 20th Century. Since 9/11, it's been continuous. The US occupied [Iraq][iraq_war] from 2003 to 2011 and [Afghanistan][afghanistan_war] from 2001 to 2021. The US also conducted [drone strikes][us_drone_strike_overview] in half a dozen countries to disrupt militant groups such as ISIS and al Qaeda. In some cases (such as [Libya][libya_drone_strikes] and [Somalia][somalia_drone_strikes]), the governments asked for US assistance against militants. In other cases (such as [Pakistan][pakistan_drone_strikes]) US strikes defied local authorities.

[^middle_east_mediation]: President Carter [hosted talks][carter_peace_talks] which led to the 1979 peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. Presidents [Clinton][clinton_two_state_solution], [Bush][bush_two_state_solution], and [Obama][obama_two_state_solution] all pursued a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. US diplomats also mediated the [2012 ceasefire][gaza_ceasefire_2012] between Israel and Hamas.

**Trump**'s foreign policy broke sharply with decades of bipartisan consensus. 
In particular, he was openly skeptical of NATO, and unconditionally supportive of Israeli expansion into disputed land.

- Trump helped [normalize relations][trump_abraham_accords] between Israel and several Arab states. But he also broke [decades of precedent][gwb_against_settlements_gaza_aid] with his disregard for Palestinian sovereignty. He [withdrew US support][trump_peace_plan] for a two-state solution. He [endorsed settlements][trump_endorses_settlements] on disputed land. He [halted humanitarian aid][trump_halted_aid] to Palestine. And he [recognized Jerusalem][trump_jerusalem] as the capital of Israel, exacerbating a long-standing obstacle to peace.
- Trump signed $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to fend off aggression from Russia, but [blocked][trump_ukraine_scandal] its distribution. He suggested that the US might [neglect its NATO treaty obligations][trump_nato] if Russia invaded Europe. He also [echoed Putin's denial][trump_helsinki] of Russian interference in US elections, contrary to FBI reports. 
- He withdrew the US from [TPP][tpp], a trade deal meant to balance China's influence in the Pacific. He then [imposed large tariffs][trump_trade_war] on imports from China, as well as smaller tariffs worldwide. Retaliatory tariffs hit US agricultural producers hard, necessitating a $28 billion bailout. Overall, the trade war cost American consumers [$72 billion][trump_tariffs_size]. There was [no lasting impact][trump_trade_war_effects] to US-China trade patterns.
- Trump imposed economic sanctions on Iran, violating the multinational [Iran Deal][trump_iran_deal]. The sanctions [crippled][iran_deal_withdrawal_economy] Iran's economy. Iran has since [resumed uranium enrichment][iran_nuclear_material] and tripled its stockpile of nuclear material.
- Trump negotiated [negotiated with the Taliban][trump_taliban_negotiations] to set a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. He released 5,000 imprisoned Taliban fighters and reduced US troop levels by 80%. The elected Afghani government was not included in negotiations. The withdrawal was completed after Trump left office. 

<!--
- They [rolled back][bh_eu_tariffs] Trump-era tariffs on imports from the EU, but [kept in place][bh_china_tariffs] tariffs on imports from China. 
- Trump negotiated [updates to NAFTA][trump_nafta]. The biggest change is an improvement to working conditions and labor rights in Mexico. This will likely help American workers in the long run, since they'll no longer need to compete with such low wages. 
- The Biden/Harris administration is the first in decades not to pursue any [new trade deals][bh_no_trade_deals]. They didn't even try to rejoin TPP. The upside of trade deals is larger markets for American corporations, as well as lower prices for American consumers; the downside is American jobs getting moved offshore. 

At Trump's suggestion, Republican legislators also [delayed aid to Ukraine][trump_ukraine_2024] for several months in 2024. 
- Trump withdrew from several Cold War [arms control][trump_inf] [treaties][trump_open_skies]. Critics argued that they tied America's hands in the Pacific since China was not party to them. 
- Trump ramped up the [Obama-era drone war][obama_drone_war] against [ISIL][isil] and other militant groups in the Middle East. He increased the number of strikes and [relaxed rules of engagement][trump_rules_of_engagement], leading to an estimated 300% increase in civilian deaths. 
- He withdrew from [UNESCO][trump_unesco] and the [UN Human Rights Council][trump_un_hrc] over alleged bias against Israel.
- He also [pardoned][trump_pardons] several military officers for war crimes in the region. 
- 
- He withdrew from the [Paris Agreement][trump_paris_agreement], an international treaty to combat climate change. 
- Trump met with the dictator of [North Korea][trump_north_korea], the first sitting president to do so. 
provided several small concessions to secure the meeting, such as cancelling joint military exercises with South Korea. 
- pledged a replacement for the iran deal but never delivered
- Trump [launched airstrikes][syria_strikes] against Syria in 2018 after Assad used chemical weapons against his own people. These strikes were supported by NATO and a handful of other nations.
- He threatened to [withdraw][trump_nato] the US from NATO, but did not follow through. 
- He removed the US from the the [UN Human Rights Council][trump_un_hrc] and [UNESCO][trump_unesco] over alleged anti-israel bias.
- He also withdrew the US from the [Open Skies Treaty][trump_open_skies], a 1992 treaty to prevent arms races.

The **Biden/Harris** administration prioritized multinational agreements to counter aggression from Russia and China. 
They scaled back direct involvement in the Middle East. 
But they have been criticized for their support to Israel during its brutal war in Gaza.

- The Biden/Harris administration sent billions of dollars in aid to Israel after the October 2023 terrorist attack and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza[^gaza]. They also leveraged the close US-Israel relationship to pursue peace. They talked Israel back from the [water siege of Gaza][gaza_water_siege]. They built a [temporary port][gaza_port] off Gaza for faster delivery of humanitarian aid. They have [mediated][ceasefire_work_2024] months of unsoccessful ceasefire talks. They support Palestinian [statehood][palestinian_statehood] as part of a postwar plan. They have [partially withheld arms][rafah_arms] over excessive civilian casualties; several prominent Democrats have pushed for a [complete halt][dem_senators_arms_embargo]. 
- Biden/Harris led the international response to [Russia's invasion of Ukraine][bh_ukraine_leadership]. He signed [$175 billion][bh_ukraine_aid] in military and humanitarian aid. They also established [clear guardrails][bh_ukraine_guardrails] to prevent direct conflict between nuclear powers.
- They strengthened relationships with [Australia][bh_pacific_australia], [India][bh_pacific_india_png], [Japan][bh_pacific_japan_korea], [Papua New Guinea][bh_pacific_india_png], [the Phillipines][bh_pacific_phillipines], and [South Korea][bh_pacific_japan_korea] in response to the growing strength of China and North Korea. 
- Biden/Harris completed the withdrawal of US forces from [Afghanistan][afghanistan_withdrawal], ending 20 years of occupation. The Taliban attacked during the final stages of the withdrawal, killing thirteen American soldiers and toppling the elected Afghani government.
- They [dramatically reduced][bh_fewer_drones] the use of drone strikes, particularly in [Yemen][yemen_drone_war]. The US continues to launch drone strikes elsewhere, such as in [Somalia][somalia_drone_strikes], where the government has asked for international help combating terrorism. 

<!-- 
- They [launched airstrikes][houthi_strikes] against Houthi rebels to stop their attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The strikes were supported by NATO and a handful of other nations.

[^gaza]: Hamas launches terrorist attacks at Israel (rockets, [suicide bombers][wiki_hamas_suicide_bombers], [sexual violence][hamas_rape]) then hide in the [tunnels under Palestinian cities][hamas_tunnels_not_bunkers]. Israel responds by bombing and [blockading][gaza_blockade] those cities, inevitably radicalizing the next round of militants. Experts have called this the world's [most intractable conflict][most_intractable_conflict]. Last October saw Hamas's largest attack yet: over a thousand Israeli civilians killed in a single day, plus hundreds more taken hostage. Israel responded by invading Gaza to eradicate Hamas.

## Executive Effectiveness 

**Context:** The president leads the executive branch of the federal government, which has over a million employees. They hand-select department heads and sign executive orders to steer priorities. Notably, these appointments and orders are often short lived, since the next president can freely reverse them.

**Trump**'s executive actions were generally in line with past Republican presidents. 
He strengthened support for employers and businesses. 
He made cuts to the safety net, labor protections, borrower protections, and environmental protections. 

- Trump [tightened requirements][trump_snap_cuts] for food stamps. About 700,000 low-income Americans lost benefits. This change saved the government an estimated $1 billion per year.
- Trump ended Obamacare insurance subsidies, saving the government about [$7 billion][trump_aca_subsidies]. He reduced funding for Obamacare enrollment outreach by about $50 million per year. He removed the Obamacare [individual mandate][trump_aca_mandate_repeal]. The number of uninsured Americans rose by [5 million][usa_uninsured_rate] from 2015 to 2018. 
- Trump withdrew the US from the [Paris Climate Accords][trump_paris_agreement] to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He also rolled back Obama-era regulations on [methane emissions][trump_methane_rollback] and [fuel efficiency][trump_car_emission_rollback]. These changes saved businesses about $120 billion in compliance costs. The average new car in 2026 will average 40 MPG, down from 46 MPG[^fuel_cost_estimate] under the previous policy. Trump also [retaliated][trump_auto_antitrust] with an antitrust probe when some automakers voluntarily kept to the stricter standards.
- Trump tightened rules around overtime, making millions of working-class Americans ineligible. This policy cost Americans an estimated $1 billion in [lost wages][trump_overtime] per year.
- Trump [waived penalties][trump_cfpb] for banks that engaged in discriminatory, deceptive, or abusive practices. [CFPB enforcement][cfpb_by_year] under Trump averaged only $0.3 billion per year (compared to $2.3 billion per year under Democratic administrations). 

[^fuel_cost_estimate]: Americans buy about 15 million new cars per year. The average car in the US drives about 14,000 miles per year. That comes out to just over 10 trillion miles driven in a new car in the decade 2017-2027. Let's say gas costs about $3 per gallon. At 37 MPG (today's new car average) that's $850 billion in fuel. Without Trump's policy change, the average would be closer to 43 MPG, in which case that same number of miles would cost $730 billion.

<!--
- Trump's FTC [sued several tech companies][trump_tech_antitrust] for anti-competitive behavior. This is the largest anti-monopoly effort in decades. The lawsuits are still in progress, and likely will be for years. 
- Trump made the first-ever attempt to [audit the Pentagon][trump_pentagon_audit]. 

- The Trump administration blocked $1 billion in loan forgiveness related to [fraud by colleges][trump_student_loan_forgiveness]. Congress passed a bill to reinstate the forgiveness, but Trump vetoed it. 
- Trump [pardoned][trump_pardons] several of his own associates for campaign finance violations, money laundering, witness tampering, and lying to the FBI. 
- Trump's EPA [refused to implement][trump_toxic_substances] the 2016 Toxic Substanced Control Act until courts forced him to do so. Looked only at chemicals currently being manufactured in large quantities. Not those already here, such as asbestos and lead. 
- Trump shortened deadlines for environmental reviews of construction projects. Challenged in court. Not clear if it really happened?
- Trump issued guidance on promoting AI, focused on US dominance in AI, guidance on how to regulate it. Supported european efforts to create global standards around AI. 
- blocked EPA from enforcing regulations on PFAS. toxic chemicals in drinking water affecting 800,000 americans. basically set everything back by 4 years. [toxic chemicals][trump_epa_pfas]. 
- Trump [banned][trump_transgender_policies] transgender Americans from serving in the military. He also rolled back protections for transgender students, patients, and inmates. 
- Trump's [Department of Education][trump_education_policy] made it harder for defrauded students to get debt relief, and easier for religious institutions to get public school funding.
- Pardoned numerous associates for fraud, campaign finance violations, money laundering, racketeering
- Issued pardons for Americans convicted of military misconduct, such as intentionally shooting protesters and civilians

The trademark executive action of the **Biden/Harris** administration is student loan forgiveness.
They also supported labor rights, loosened marijuana policy, and took steps to combat climate change. 

- Biden/Harris forgave $160+ billion in [student debt][bh_student_loans] for over 5 million borrowers, despite [push-back from the Supreme Court][bh_student_loan_courts]. They also put new regulations in place to [expose][bh_gainful_employment_rule] colleges and universities that do not lead to gainful employment.  
- The NLRB under Biden/Harris has made it [easier for workers to organize][bh_nlrb]. Union membership is up, and 2023 was the [biggest year][more_strikes] for strikes in decades. The administration also declined to use federal authority to break a high-profile [port strike][bh_port_strike_agreement] in 2024. 
- Biden/Harris [expanded access to overtime pay][bh_overtime] for 4 million Americans. The estimated impact is [$1.5 billion][bh_overtime_impact] in additional wages per year.
- They [rescheduled marijuana][bh_reschedule_marijuana] from Category I (heroin, LSD) to Category III (ketamine, testosterone). They also [pardoned thousands][bh_marijuana_pardon] of Americans imprisoned for nonviolent drug offenses. 
- Biden/Harris rejoined the Paris Climate Accords. They also put a plan in motion to [decarbonize the federal government][bh_decarbonize_federal_govt]. The federal fleet of 600,000 cars and trucks is projected to be zero-emission by 2035, and the 300,000 federal buildings will run on renewables by 2050.

## Constitutional Integrity

**Context:** The Constitution lays out the process for elections and the peaceful transfer of power. It's the foundation upon which the entire government is built. The president is sworn to uphold it.

**Trump** brazenly and repeatedly put his own political power above his oath to the US Constitution.
His efforts to overturn the 2020 election were particularly chilling. 
If the president has the power to ignore election results, then elections no longer matter.

- Trump [fired][trump_fires_comey] the head of the FBI, seemingly to disrupt an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. A special counsel was appointed to follow up. The resulting [report][mueller_report] did not charge Trump with a crime, but also did not exonerate him. They found numerous contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials. They also showed that Trump repeatedly attempted to exert "undue influence" to disrupt the investigation. Several men were convicted of lying to the FBI and witness tampering. Trump later [pardoned][trump_pardons] them.
- As president, Trump [publicly asked][trump_ukraine_scandal] Ukraine and China to interfere in the 2020 election in his favor. He withheld military aid from Ukraine in an attempt to blackmail them into fabricating dirt on his political opponents. 
- Trump [baselessly denied][trump_big_lie] the legitimacy of his 2020 election loss, and attempted to overturn the results to remain in power. He called the top election official in Georgia and [pressured him to lie about the results][ga_sos_call]. He recruited electors in seven states to submit [fraudulent results][trump_fake_electors]. And he [incited a mob][jan_6] to storm the capitol and disrupt the certification of his loss. Had his efforts succeeded, it would have been the end of the republic. Elections are meaningless if the president has the power to ignore them.

Trump's actions were unprecedented in American history.
**Biden and Harris** have done nothing remotely comparable.

- Obama and Biden left office without incident after Trump won the 2016 election. As VP, Biden even certified Trump's victory.
- As president, Biden/Harris passed [updates to the election process][bh_electoral_reform] to close the loopholes Trump attempted to exploit.
- The Biden/Harris administration appointed a [special counsel][bh_special_counsel] to investigate conspiracies around the 2020 election. Trump has been indicted, but the trial is unlikely to complete before the 2024 election.

<!--
- Biden won the Democratic primaries handily. He then [bowed out][biden_withdraws] and endorsed Harris. Critics called it a [coup][trump_harris_coup] and questioned the legitimacy of her candidacy. That's nonsense. Stepping in for the president is the VP's job. The vast majority of party delegates agreed, and [officially nominated][dnc] Harris at the DNC.

## Summary

Trump advanced some right-wing priorities: he signed a tax cut for the rich, nominated anti-abortion judges, and cut regulation on businesses. 
But he often seemed to care less about policy outcomes and more about picking fights. 
He undermined the pandemic response of his own administration.
He blocked aid to Americans after a devastating hurricane. 
He started a trade war with China, winning nothing and losing billions. 
He caused the longest federal shutdown in history.
And, worst of all, he brazenly prioritized his own political power over his oath to the Constitution. 

The Biden/Harris administration advanced some left-wing priorities: they forgave billions in student debt, strengthened unions, and passed a huge investment in clean energy.
But more importantly, they're a steady hand on the wheel. 
They led the US through a smoother COVID recovery than any other nation. 
They passed landmark investments in infrastructure and manufacturing. 
They scaled back US entanglements in the Middle East.
And they strengthened America's relationships with global allies. 

Either Harris or Trump will be president next year.
Please vote to help ensure it's the better one.
