At the 1532 Battle of Cajamarca, 168 Spaniards led by Francisco Pizarro killed thousands of Incas and captured Emperor Atahuallpa without suffering a single casualty.
Immediate causes of the lopsided interaction are clear enough.
Europe had the political structures and seafaring technology to send expeditions across the ocean;
European soldiers rode horses and wore steel armor;
Native Americans were devastated by European diseases such as smallpox;
the written word allowed Pizarro to model his ambush on the successful tactics of Cortés;
and so on.
In his 1997 bestseller *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, Jared Diamond digs into history (and pre-history) in search of an ultimate explanation to why civilizations on different continents developed technology at such different rates.

Right off the bat, the author addresses the elephant in the room: it's not about race.
In terms of biology, humans are all pretty much the same.
And besides, most of Pizarro's technologies were originally imported from the Middle East or Asia, not developed in Europe.








criticism: lots of focus on middle east climate, native plants, etc. but rice was domesticated about the same time. why so little discussion of that?



Even if you believe that Europeans are innately superior --- which the author emphatically does not --- such an argument raises more questions than in answers.
What unique evolutionary pressure caused Europeans to supposedly diverge from the rest of humanity about 10,000 years ago?
And after Europeans did diverge from the rest of humanity,

that's not an ultimate explanation.

From there you'd need to describe what unique evolutionary pressures gave rise




And even if there were differences between the races, that still wouldn't be an ultimate explanation.

For example, if we credit Confucianism for China's technological breakthroughs, now we have to explain why similar philosophies did not become dominant elsewhere!

Diamond spends nearly 500 pages pulling together ideas from archeology, evolutionary biology, geography, and even linguistics. But in the end, his argument is so straightforward it's almost anticlimactic. In a word: wheat.

Agriculture is incredibly important to the development of technology. Farming allows greater population density than hunter-gathering, and also frees up resources for art, science, and politics.

Starting 13000 years ago, around the end of the last ice age.
Anatomically modern humans are widespread across the globe, including islands like New Guinea.
Warming climate coincides with growing human populations.
Large wild animals become less plentiful due to a combination of climate and hunting.
Climate becomes more friendly to wild cereals, especially in mediterranean areas.

fertile crescent is the largest and most varied mediterranean biome on the planet. no surprise that the most (and best) grasses would evolve there.







About 13,000 years ago:

- The last ice age ended. the climate warmed.
- Human populations grew
- Most species of large herbivore went extinct worldwide
- Different plant species flourished due to the warming climate

biologically modern humans were already living worldwide, including remote pacific islands

middle east: wheat in 8500bc
china: rice by 7500bc
central america: corn by 3500bc
sahel: sorghum by 5000bc

linguistics. did farming spread or did farme*rs* spread. also skeletal structure

similar climates: south africa, mediterranean, california, sw australia

first farmers worked harder, were smaller, died younger than hunter gatherers

shifting from mostly wild food to mostly cultivated took thousands of years

8500bc vs 18500bs. wild game less abundant. wild cereals more abundant due to climate. technology for storage. density high enough to value calories per acre. p112

some areas suitable for food production but HGs never displaced due to geography. CA separated by desert from AZ. south africa with a different climate from tropical bantu crops. australia separated by sea from NG, indonesia. p113

wild almonds are bitter and toxic, but it's just one gene. early humans would find non-bitter ones by accident, interact preferrentially, propagate by accident then intentionally. p118

barley, wheat, peas, lentils, flax, poppies. natural seed dispersal threw seeds on the ground. single gene caused that to fail, making them much easier to harvest. accidental domestication since those are the ones that got propagated. p120

food production, rising density. chicken and egg. p111

table by crop type. cereal, bean, tuber. p126

plowing important for monoculture. p128

some species we failed to domesticate until recently. acorns, strawberries. p129

All staple foods were domesticated thousands of years ago. Some recent fruits and veggies but no grains or beans to build a civilization on. p133

it's not about one species. you need enough domesticatable stuff around that hunter gatherers evolve to become sedentary. wild apples exist in north america, but it's not enough. p134

Mediterranean climate select for human-friendly crops. p136

wheat and barley require minimal domestication, self-pollinate. corn required extensive domestication. p137

modern systematic evaluation of wild grasses. nothing else as good. p146

New Guinea. anatomically modern people have been there 40k years. longer than americas, western europe. plenty of time to become familiar with plants. not very productive wild plants for hunting and gathering, so pressure to switch to food production. but no cereals or beans, minimal game. protein deficiency. also: they readily adopted sweet potatoes when exposed centuries ago. population boom. plenty willing to give good things a chance. p147-150

protein content of rice, wheat, etc. p149

eastern usa also limited by available plants. corn beans squash around 900ad. triggered population boom. p151-2

agriculture is great. but the transition from hunter-gatherer society to sedentary farming is hard. wheat is really high in calories and protein so there's more room for error. grasses native to other parts of the world are less good.

Early conflicts with Europeans were similarly lopsided in Australia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Compared to hunting and gathering, farming allows more people to live on the same amount of land. Some of those people can even take on non-farming roles.

larger society supports more specialized roles
as the society grows larger, roles become specialized

Dedicated warriors secure resources.
Dedicated bureaucrats allocate them.

inventors

politicians need written language to handle resource allocation in a big society
technological innovation to prevent being displaced by a more advanced neighbor

Warriors force neighboring societies to assimilate or be displaced.

artisans, leaders, and warriors. scientists. inventors

A farmer can grow enough wheat to feed their family, plus a surplus to feed others, all with less land than a band of hunter-gatherers would require to survive.

Higher population density becomes possible, as do specialized roles such as leader and warrior.

Those neighbors can then take on other specialized roles like artisan, leader, or warrior.
Any nearby hunter-gatherer societies, unable to compete with

Higher population density becomes feasible, as do specialized roles like artisan and warrior.

Farming allows a society higher population density than hunting and gathering.

It also frees up resources to

As a result,
Farming societies can support higher population density than hunter-gatherer societies.
Centralized food production also makes other specialized roles possible, such as artisans, leaders, and warriors.

This makes higher population density possible, and also frees up resources for other members of that society to take on specialized roles like leader or
In a hunter-gatherer society, everyone's job is a matter of survival: finding food, securing shelter, raising children, and so on.

It becomes possible to support full-time artisans, leaders, and warriors.

Wheat is native to the Middle East.
It was domesticated first by accident, then intentionally as hunter-gatherer societies gradually became sedentary.

Hunter-gatherer societies gradually became sedentary.

Corn is native to the Americas.
Africa has teff and millet.
Europe and Asia were fortunate enough to have wheat.



Modern researchers have attempted domestication of other native grasses

In a word, the answer is wheat.
