The following is loosely based on [this recipe](http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2013/02/shakshuka-recipe-eggs). I don't really recall how I stumbled upon it, but I immediately knew I wanted to give it a try. My version is modified significantly (only one onion? psh!) but the general idea of the dish is the same.

Turn on the oven to 200C (400F). Roast **2 red bell peppers** for about 45 minutes, until blackened on the outside. When they come out of the oven, put them immediately into a bowl and cover them with a towel to steam. Leave the oven on.

While the peppers are in the oven, throw some **olive oil** and **3 diced onions** (about 1000 ml or 4 cups) in a large skillet. Cook them on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they caramelize to a deep brown. This may take half an hour or more. It's worth it.

After the peppers have steamed for 5-10 minutes, the blackened skin should slide off easily. (If it doesn't, use a knife to scrape it off.) Discard the skin and seeds, chop the peppers, and stir them in with the onions.

Add **5 cloves minced garlic** (probably about 30 ml or 2 tbs) and **5 ml each of cumin, paprika, caraway, turmeric, cayenne, salt, and black pepper** (1 tsp each). Stir this around until it starts to smell irresistible, just a few minutes, then add **800 ml diced tomatoes** (one 28-oz can). (If available, go for the [fire roasted](https://www.muirglen.com/) ones.) You may optionally also add bacon, kalamata olives, whole garlic cloves, or hot peppers. Simmer everything together for 20 minutes or so, stirring occasionally, to melt all of the flavors into one another.

Quickly divide the sauce into ramekins (I use four two-cup Pyrex storage containers). Cube **100 ml feta cheese** (1/2 cup) and press those cubes into the sauce. Then use a spoon to hollow out a crater in each ramekin, and crack an **egg** into it.

Bake until the white is just barely set, about 15 minutes. The yolk should still be runny when it's done. This recipe makes four servings with crusty bread.
